&nbsp;      - "Require approvals ledger entry referencing safeops.dangerous_commands before executing Apply."

&nbsp;   3) PLAN:

&nbsp;      - "Emit PLAN.md; list gates and budgets to be enforced."

&nbsp;   4) TEST:

&nbsp;      - "Run tests; if preview present, generate audit\_handoff.json."

&nbsp;   5) PATCH:

&nbsp;      - "Apply minimal diff; atomic write; verify hashes and LF."

&nbsp;   6) Evidence:

&nbsp;      - "Write manifest.jsonl {ts,actor,delegate,tools,inputs\_hash,outputs\_hash,bytes,duration\_ms,confidence}."
